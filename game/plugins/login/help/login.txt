To get past the login screen, you need a character.  There are a number of 'guest' characters available that you can borrow just to log in and look around.  You can connect to one by typing:

    %xcconnect guest%xn

Also from the login screen, you can create a new character or connect to an existing one.  If you ever forget your password, use the 'tour' command and contact staff.

    %xccreate <name> <password>%xn
    %xcconnect <name> <password>%xn

Names will normally be your character's first or last name, and can only be a single word.  You should take care to consider the game's theme when choosing your name.

You can associate an email address with your account, to enable admin to contact you.

    %xcemail%xn - Views your registered email
    %xcemail/set <email>%xn - Changes the email registered with your account.
    
Other login-related commands:

    %xcquit%xn - Disconnects from the game.
    %xcpassword/set <oldpassword>=<newpassword>%xn - Changes your password.
