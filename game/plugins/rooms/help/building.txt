The MUSH grid consists of %xhRooms%xn connected by %xhExits%xn.  Admin with appropriate permissions can create these using the build and open commands.

    %xcbuild <name>[=<outgoing exit name>,<return exit name>]%xn - Creates a room.
    %xcopen <exit>[=<destination>]%xn - Creates an exit.
    %xclink <exit>=<destination>%xn - Links an exit to a room.
    %xcunlink <exit>%xn - Unlinks an exit from its destination.

Note: In Ares, exits have only a single name so there is no exit;alias;alias syntax.  Any exit named "O" is automatically aliased to "Out".

If you create rooms without exits, you may need to use the room directory command to find them again.

    %xcrooms%xn - Shows all rooms and their database IDs.
    %xcrooms <name>%xn - Searches for a room matching the given name.

You can destroy rooms and exits using the %xcdestroy%xn command.
